        "Contenido": "6. CLEANOUT DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING\n OF PARTS IN CONTACT WITH THE PRODUCT\n6.1 GENERAL INFORMATION\nCleaning and sanitisation are operations that must be carried out habitually and with maximum \ncare at the end of each production run to guarantee the production quality and respect the \nnecessary hygienic norms. \nGiving dirt the time to dry out can greatly increase the risk of rings, marks and damage to \nsurfaces. \nRemoving dirt is much easier if it is done immediately after use because some elements \ncontaining acid and saline substances might corrode the surfaces. A prolonged soaking is not \nrecommended. \n6.2 WASHING CONDITIONS\n\u2022 Avoid using solvents, alcohol or detergents that could damage machine parts or \npollute the functional production parts. \n\u2022 When manually washing never utilise powder or abrasive products, abrasive sponges \nor pointed tools. There is a risk of dulling the surfaces, removing or deteriorating the \nprotective film that is present on the surface and scoring the surface. \n\u2022 Never use metal scouring pads or synthetic abrasives that could cause oxidization or \ncompromise the surfaces integrity. \n\u2022 Avoid using detergents that contain chlorine and its composites. The use of detergents such \nas bleach, ammonia, hydrochloric acid and limescale removers can attack the composition \nof the steel, marking and oxidising it irreparably and causing damage to the parts made \nfrom plastic materials \n\u2022 Do not use dishwashers and their detergent products.\n6.3 TIPS \n\u2022 Use a non-aggressive detergent solution to wash the parts.\n\u2022 Manually wash the parts in water (max 60\u00b0C) using a non-aggressive detergent and the \ncleaning brushes supplied as standard. \n\u2022 Use drinking water (bacteriologically pure) to rinse the parts. \n\u2022 To sanitise leave the disassembled parts in sanitised lukewarm water for the time indicated \non the sanitising product label and rinse them before reassembling. \n\u2022 When the washing procedure has been completed and before reassembly, dry each \ncomponent thoroughly with a clean and soft cloth that is suitable for coming into contact \nwith foodstuffs, to avoid leaving any humidity rich in mineral salts and chlorine that could \nattack the metal surfaces and leave opaque traces. \nIceteam 1927 recommends the use of a cleaning/sanitising solution to wash the machine .\nThe use of a cleaning/sanitising solution optimises the washing and sanitising procedures in \nthat it eliminates two phases of the procedure (a rinse and a washing phase). Basically, the use \nof a cleaning/sanitising solution saves time by facilitating and simplifying washing/ sanitising \nprocedures. \nWARNING  \nEvery time the machine is washed and the parts that come into contact with the ice cr eam \nmix are disassembled, it is essential to carry out a visual inspection of all the parts made \nin thermosetting, plastic, elastomer-based and silicon-based materials and metal such as \nsliding shoes, pump gears, beaters, etc. ).  \nAll parts must be integral and not worn, without cracks or splits, or opaque if originally \npolished/transparent.  \nIceteam 1927 declines all responsibility for any damage caused by imperfections and/or \nundetected breakages and not promptly solved by the replacement with original spare \nparts. The manufacturer is available for consultation and for any specific requests made \nby the customer.\n6.5   CLEANOUT\nTo clean the machine do as follows:\n1 Fill both cylinders with water using the special hose.\n2 After filling with water, press the key BEATING  for heating side and the key BEATING  \nfor production side.\n When programmed time has elapsed, the machine will automatically set at STOP position.\n3 By first turning the lever 502 and then lowering the handle 5, let all water come out of the \ncylinders.\n4 After emptying the freezing cylinder, (front lid is opened by lifting the lever 289 and pull -\ning it to the right), it is advisable to clean the cylinder with a bolt of water while keeping \nthe beater blocked in its seat.\n5 Remove the drip tray 27, then wash and sanitize it.\n6 Remove the tub support shelf 50, then wash and sanitize it.\nCAUTION  \nWhen removing and refitting the tub support shelf, be careful of any risks to hands or \nfingers through crushing.\n 7 Wipe the machine exterior clean with a damp cloth before sanitizing. 6.4 HOW TO USE CLEANING/SANITISING SOLUTION\nPrepare a solution of water and sanitising detergent following the instructions shown on the label \nof the product being utilised.\nWashing/sanitisation by immersion of components\n- Manually remove the bulk residues utilising the supplied brushes\n- Remove finer residues with a jet of water\n- Immerse the parts to be cleaned into the solution\n- Let the solution react for the time indicated on the label of the product being utilised\n- Rinse the parts with care, using plenty of clean drinking water\n502351\n2895\n6.6 SPIGOT DOOR SINGLE EXIT AND UPPER BEATER \n(BOILER) DISASSEMBLY\nTo disassemble spigot door 7, unlock it by lifting lever 289 and moving it to the right.\n\uf06c Slide O-Ring 1239  out and remove spigot door protection 257.\n\uf06c Open the spigot door, move it to the left and lift it by sliding it out of the pin.\n\uf06c\tUnscrew the door piston control l ever 300 (fig. 1) and push the door piston 030 to th e right \nof the door to extract it (fig. 2).\n\uf06c Disassemble seals 303 and 291  using the suitable puller, thoroughly clean them and lubricate \nwith food grade grease before re-assembling them.\n11\n 22\n\uf06c Disassemble spigot door cover 290 by sliding retaining pin 6 out and remove spigot door \nclosure 350.\n\uf06c Clean and sanitize all disassembled parts.\n\uf06c Disassemble beater 21 by removing it from its seat, slide seal 28 out and then clean and sanitize.\n\uf06c Slide out flavor holder 547, O-Rings 1131  and 1136 , cover 370, spoke 48, clean and sanitize \nthem. \n\uf06c Clean and sanitize cylinder internal wall.\n\uf06c Re-assemble beater and spigot door repeating the previous procedures in reverse order.\nWARNING\nPay attention to the correct positioning of the OR 303 while refitting it on the spigot \npiston 030.
