        "Content": "SAFETY\nWhen using the machine, one must be aware of the fact that drive mechanisms (rotary motion), \nhigh voltage components, as well as parts subject to high temperatures may cause serious damage \nto persons and things.\nPersons in charge of plant safety must make sure that:\n\uf06c any incorrect use or handling is avoided;\n\uf06c\tsafety devices are not removed or tampered with;\n\uf06c\tthe machine is regularly serviced;\n\uf06c\tonly original spare parts are used especially as far as those components with safety functions \nare concerned (ex.: protection microswitches, thermostats);\n\uf06c\tsuitable personal protective equipment is worn;\n\uf06c\tattention is paid during hot product cycling.   \nTo achieve the above, the following is necessary:\n\uf06c  at the work station an instruction manual relevant to the machine should be available;\n\uf06c such documentation must be carefully read and requirements must consequently be met;\n\uf06c The appliance is only to be installed in locations where its use and maintenance is restricted \nto trained personnel.\n\uf06c\tonly adequately skilled personnel should be assigned to electrical equipment; this appliance is \nnot intended for use by persons (including children) with reduced physical, sensory or mental  \ncapabilities, or lack of experience and knowledge, unless they have been given supervision \nor instruction concerning use of the appliance by a person responsible for their safety;\n\uf06c  Make sure that no technician will ever carry out interventions outside his own knowledge and \nresponsibility sphere;\n\uf06c  Children should be supervised to ensure that they do not play with the appliance.\nIMPORTANT!\nMake sure that the staff does not carry out any operation outside their own sphere of knowledge \nand responsibility (refer to \u201cSymbology qualification of the staf f\u201d).\nNOTE:\nAccording to the standard in force, a QUALIFIED ENGINEER is a person who, thanks to:\n- training, experience and education,\n- knowledge of rules, prescriptions and interventions on accident prevention,\n- knowledge of machine operating conditions, \nis able to recognise and avoid any danger and who has also been allowed by the person in \ncharge of plant safety to carry out all kinds of interventions.\n WARNINGS\n\u2022 Never put your hand into the machine, alike during production and cleaning operations. Before \ncarrying out any maintenance operation, make sure that the machine is in \u201c STOP \u201d position \nand main switch has been cut out.\n\u2022 It is forbidden to wash the machine by means of a bolt of water under pressure.\n\u2022 It is forbidden to remove panels in order to reach the machine inside before having disconnected the machine.\n\u2022 The place of installation must not be exposed to water sprays, high moisture, heat or steam sources.\n\u2022 Do not store explosive substances or spray bottles inside the machine, nor bottles for aerosol \nwith flammable propellants.\n\u2022 ICETEAM 1927  is not responsible for any accident that might happen during operation, \ncleaning and/or servicing of its units, if this warning ha s not been fully complied with."

        "Content": "1. RECEIVING, MOVING, OPENING THE PACKING\n1.1 RECEPTION\n-  Before unpacking the machine, check that packing shows no external damages due to  collisions \nduring transportation.\n-  An external damage could mean the machine itself is damaged: in this case, immediately apply \nto insurance company and leave everything as it was on reception.\n1.1.1   Lifting a packed machine\nTo lift the packing, insert lift forks into the space be tween pallet feet, so as to balance the machine weight \nand consequently packing barycenter.\n1.1.2  Forbidden material handling  \n equipment\nMaterial handling equipment not in compliance with \nfollowing safety characteristics must never be used:\n-  Lifting capacity lower than machine weight or \nunsuitable construction features of the lift (ex.: too \nshort forks)\n-  Unconforming ropes and cables or worn ropes or \ncables \n1.2 OPENING A PACKING CRATE\nA wooden packing  can be opened by means of  proper tools; \nit is recommended to protect exposed parts, such as hands with \ngloves, against wood splinters.\n1- Remove nails starting from the upper part until the machine \nstill fastened to the pallet (board) is left uncovered. \n2- Remove protection film wrapping the machine.\n3- Check that the machine has not been damaged during trans portation.\nBoard packing  is externally closed by steel straps.\n1- Cut the steel straps with a pair of tin shears, holding one side \nwith the free hand. \n2- Remove the packing by lifting it vertically up.\n3- Remove the protective polystyrene packing and \nthe polypropilene bag.\n4- Cut the steel straps which secure the machine to \nthe base.\nCAUTION\nAct with utmost care, as one may hurt himself \nwhen cutting the straps, if they are not strongly \nheld during this operation.\n1.2.1  Machine removal from pallet\n1- Remove the four screw fastening both bars between pallet and machine.\n4- Descent of machine from skid must be controlled by TWO people, one standing by machine \nrear and the other by frontside\nCAUTION\nWhile moving the machine, mind it does not run too fast or it does not stop suddenly \nagainst the floor, as in both cases it might overturn thus bringing about damage to people \nand/or things all around.CAUTION\nRemoval from pallet must be carried out from TWO people properly instructed in \nmaterial handling. Remove machine from pallet only after carefully reading following \ninstructions.\n2- Place the wooden skid the machine is equipped with, in relation to the machine rear.\n3- Push the machine from its rear till both bars drop, thence withdraw them sideaway.\n1.3  STORING A MACHINE\nThe machine must be stored in a dry and dump-free place. \nBefore storing the machine, wrap it in a cloth in order to protect it against dust and else.\nIMPORTANT:\nWhen storing a packed machine, never place a crate on another.\n1.4 DISPOSAL OF PACKING STUFFS\nWhen opening the packing crate, divide packing stuffs per type and get rid of them according to \nlaws in force in machine installation country.\n1.5 WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment)\nIn conformity with the European Directives 2006/66/EC, on batteries and accumulators and waste \nbatteries and accumulators, and 2002/96/EC, also known as WEEE, the presence of the symbol on \nthe side of the product or packaging means that the product must not be disposed of with normal \nurban waste. Instead, it is the user\u2019s responsibility to dispose of this product by returning it to \na collection point designated for the recycling/treatment of electrical and electronic equipment \nwaste.
