      "    \"Cleanout Disassembling And Reassembling\": \"6. CLEANOUT DISASSEMBLING AND REASSEMBLING\\n OF PARTS IN CONTACT WITH THE PRODUCT\\n6.1 GENERAL INFORMATION\\nCleaning and sanitisation are operations that must be carried out habitually and with maximum \\ncare at the end of each production run to guarantee the production quality and respect the \\nnecessary hygienic norms. \\nGiving dirt the time to dry out can greatly increase the risk of rings, marks and damage to \\nsurfaces. \\nRemoving dirt is much easier if it is done immediately after use because some elements \\ncontaining acid and saline substances might corrode the surfaces. A prolonged soaking is not \\nrecommended. \\n6.2 WASHING CONDITIONS\\n\\u2022 Avoid using solvents, alcohol or detergents that could damage machine parts or \\npollute the functional production parts. \\n\\u2022 When manually washing never utilise powder or abrasive products, abrasive sponges \\nor pointed tools. There is a risk of dulling the surfaces, removing or deteriorating the \\nprotective film that is present on the surface and scoring the surface. \\n\\u2022 Never use metal scouring pads or synthetic abrasives that could cause oxidization or \\ncompromise the surfaces integrity. \\n\\u2022 Avoid using detergents that contain chlorine and its composites. The use of detergents such \\nas bleach, ammonia, hydrochloric acid and limescale removers can attack the composition \\nof the steel, marking and oxidising it irreparably and causing damage to the parts made \\nfrom plastic materials \\n\\u2022 Do not use dishwashers and their detergent products.\\n6.3 TIPS \\n\\u2022 Use a non-aggressive detergent solution to wash the parts.\\n\\u2022 Manually wash the parts in water (max 60\\u00b0C) using a non-aggressive detergent and the \\ncleaning brushes supplied as standard. \\n\\u2022 Use drinking water (bacteriologically pure) to rinse the parts. \\n\\u2022 To sanitise leave the disassembled parts in sanitised lukewarm water for the time indicated \\non the sanitising product label and rinse them before reassembling. \\n\\u2022 When the washing procedure has been completed and before reassembly, dry each \\ncomponent thoroughly with a clean and soft cloth that is suitable for coming into contact \\nwith foodstuffs, to avoid leaving any humidity rich in mineral salts and chlorine that could \\nattack the metal surfaces and leave opaque traces. \\nIceteam 1927 recommends the use of a cleaning/sanitising solution to wash the machine .\\nThe use of a cleaning/sanitising solution optimises the washing and sanitising procedures in \\nthat it eliminates two phases of the procedure (a rinse and a washing phase). Basically, the use \\nof a cleaning/sanitising solution saves time by facilitating and simplifying washing/ sanitising \\nprocedures. \\nWARNING  \\nEvery time the machine is washed and the parts that come into contact with the ice cr eam \\nmix are disassembled, it is essential to carry out a visual inspection of all the parts made \\nin thermosetting, plastic, elastomer-based and silicon-based materials and metal such as \\nsliding shoes, pump gears, beaters, etc. ).  \\nAll parts must be integral and not worn, without cracks or splits, or opaque if originally \\npolished/transparent.  \\nIceteam 1927 declines all responsibility for any damage caused by imperfections and/or \\nundetected breakages and not promptly solved by the replacement with original spare \\nparts.
